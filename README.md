# Cross-Course Project

This is my Cross-Course Project, a project I've worked on and refined for several of the Noroff Courses. The project is known as Game Hub, a digital games marketplace.

## Description

Game Hub is a digital marketplace designed to be both sleek and functional, having passed through several stages to further refine the original design. The project was designed in Adobe XD, and initially made without Javascript, which was added in later stages of the project.
